1) Create a S3 bucket by the name "prageyabucket".


2) Create an IAM Policy and copy the following json file in it:-

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
                      ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::prageyabucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::prageyabucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}


3) Create a group called "s3users" and attach the policy which we just created.


4) Create a user called "S3user" and add it to the group(s3users) which we just created.

5) Now login with the IAM user which we have created. It will only be able to access the "prageyabucket" and nothing else.
