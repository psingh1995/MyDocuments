				DEPLOY STATIC WEBSITE TO AWS S3 WITH HTTPS USING CLOUDFRONT
				
STEPS:-


1) Go to S3 and create a bucket. For hosting website, the bucket name has to be same as the websitename.
Also allow public access to the bucket.

- Upload website to the bucket (index.html and error.html pages).

- Go to Properties --> Static Website Hosting --> Edit --> Enable --> specify index.html and error.html --> Save Changes

- Go to Permissions --> Bucket Policy --> Edit (and add the following code): --> Save Changes
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

2) Now we have to attach a SSL Certificate to our website.(we can only create certificate in North Virginia region for now)
- Go to Certificate Manager --> Request Certificate(Public Certificate) --> enter your Domain Name --> Tags --> DNS Validation --> Confirm & Request


3) Copy the CNAME generated by Certificate Manager and go to your domain service provider and paste the CNAME in there record.


4) Create a Cloudfront Distribution.
Select Origin Domain (your S3 webiste address) --> Redirect HTTP to HTTPS --> Alternate Domain Name (add the domain name which we have bought and are going to use) --> choose SSL Certificate (which we created in AWS) --> Default root object (put the name=index.html in this which is our main website file) -> Create Distribution

- We can use the url created by Distribution Domain Name to access our website on https.

5) Go to your Domain Name provider and paste the 'Distribution Domain Name url' in the records there under CNAME.

6) Now we can access our website by our domain name securely on the HTTPS.
