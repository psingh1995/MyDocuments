STEPS:-

1) Create an IAM policy and paste the following json code in it:-
	
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Start*",
        "ec2:Stop*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}



2) Now create a role and add the policy which we created earlier.



3) Go to Lambda and create 2 different functions for start and stop using the role we have created:-


	- for Stop instance function, paste the following python3.7 code in the lambda:-

import boto3
region = 'ap-south-1'
instances = ['i-070ce588ad11318ec']
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
    print('stopped your instances: ' + str(instances))


	- for Start instance function, paste the following python3.7 code in the lambda:-

import boto3
region = 'ap-south-1'
instances = ['i-12345', 'i-2345']
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
    print('started your instances: ' + str(instances))
    
    
    
4) Go to CloudWatch --> Events --> Rules --> Create Rule
We have to create 2 different rules for START and STOP.

	- for START rule, click Create rule --> Schedule --> Cron expression --> Set the time for server to start in cron (5 8 * * ? 0 -for starting at 8:05am on every SUnday) --> Targets --> Lambda function --> select the lambda function for START which we created earlier --> Give a name and desription for the rule --> Create rule 
	
	- for STop rule, click Create rule --> Schedule --> Cron expression --> Set the time for server to stop in cron (0 17 * * ? 0 -for stoping at 5:00pm on every SUnday) --> Targets --> Lambda function --> select the lambda function for STOP which we created earlier --> Give a name and desription for the rule --> Create rule 
    
    
    
5) Now the EC2 instance will start and stop automatically at the time which we have given.
